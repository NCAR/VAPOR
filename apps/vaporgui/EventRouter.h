//! \brief A pure virtual class specifying the common properties of 
//! all the parameter tabs in the VAPOR GUI
//! \author Alan Norton
//! \version 3.0
//! \date  May 2015

//!	The EventRouter class manages communication between
//! tabs in the GUI, visualizers, and params.
//! Implementers of new tabs in vaporgui must implement an EventRouter class 
//! that translates user actions in 
//! the tab to changes in the corresponding Params instance, and conversely, 
//! populates the tab display based on the
//! most recent state of the params.
//!
//! EventRouter classes are currently of two types:  Those that are 
//! associated with RenderParams and those that are not.
//! Those that are associated with RenderParams support having multiple 
//! sub-tabs, and are presented in the RenderHolder
//! that displays the parameters of the currently selected renderer.  
//! Other EventRouter classes are themselves tabs
//! and have their content defined by a Qt Designer .ui file.
//! Such EventRouter classes are derived from the _UI class that is based 
//! on the .ui widget. 
//!
//! Each widget in the tab is connected to slots in the EventRouter by 
//! signals emitted by the widget when its state is changed.  The 
//! connections must
//! be set up in the EventRouter::hookUpTab() method. 
//!
//! In addition to implementing the various pure virtual methods on this 
//! class, additional virtual methods
//! must be implemented to support changes in rendering, Transfer 
//! Functions, etc., based on the functionality of the tab.
//!
//! Specifically, each EventRouter subclass implementor must provide 
//! the following:
//!
//! Implement hookUpTab() to connect all signals/slots that are 
//! permanent (not data dependent).  If some 
//! widgets are created dynamically, the appropriate connections must 
//! be established at that time.
//!
//! Implement _updateTab() to set the values of all gui elements based 
//! on current Params settings, whenever the tab is exposed.
//!
//! Implement _confirmText() to read all the text values in the 
//! tab and set them in the Params
//!
//! Implement a slot for each widget in the tab to respond to user changes, 
//! except QLineEdits get two slots 
//! (as described in EventRouter::hookUpTab()) )
//!
//!
//! Call confirmText() in the slots associated with each widget change, 
//! so that text changes are updated prior to committing the widget change.
//!
//! If any data variables are associated with the tab (for RenderParams), 
//! include the VariablesWidget as a tab inside this gui tab.
//! Note that the VariablesWidget handles its own signals and slots.
//!
//! If there is a MouseMode (manipulator) associated with the tab, 
//! then EventRouter::captureMouseUp() and 
//! EventRouter::captureMouseDown() must be implemented.
//!
//

 //! router.
 //!
 virtual VAPoR::ParamsBase *GetActiveParams() const;

 //! Virtual method connects all the Qt signals and slots 
 //! associated with the tab.
 //! Must also include connections that send signals when any QTextEdit box 
 //! is changed and when enter is pressed.
 //! Each QLineEdit has a connection to a setTextChanged and enterPressed 
 //! slot, to register when the value has changed,
 //! and when the user has pressed enter over the lineEdit.
 //! If there is a MapperFunction editor or IsoSelection panel in the 
 //! tab, call MappingFrame::hookup() in this method
 //!
 virtual void hookUpTab() {}

 //! Pure virual method that returns documentation URLs
 //!
 //! \param[out] help A vector of string pairs. The first string is a 
 //! descriptive text. The secone is a URL.

 //! Update GUI display
 //!
 //! This method set the values of all the gui elements in the tab based on 
 //! current Params state.
 //! This will do appropriate setup and then invoke the pure 
 //! virtual method _updateTab().
 //! This is invoked whenever the tab is redisplayed and the values in the tab 
 //! need to be refreshed.
 //!
 //! The method has three responsibilities:
 //! 1. Reconcile any anomalous conditions between the DataMgr and the 
 //! Params instance managed by this event router. Thus if the Params
 //! instance contains values that would be viable with the current DataMgr
 //! (e.g. a variable name that is not present in the DataMgr) the method
 //! will attempt to change the Params instance to a valid state.
 //!
 //! 2. Refresh (rebuild) the GUI to reflect the state of the Params.
 //!
 //! 3. Ensure that the options presented by the GUI are viable for the
 //! current DataMgr.
 //!
 virtual void updateTab();

 //! Method to respond to changes in text in the tab.  
 //! This method should be called whenever user presses enter, or changes 
 //! the state of
 //! a widget (other than a textEdit) in the tab.
 //!
 virtual void confirmText();


 //! Set the TextChanged flag.  The flag should be turned on whenever any 
 //! textbox (affecting the 
 //! state of the Params) changes in the tab.  The change will not take 
 //! effect until confirmText() is called.
 //! The flag will be turned off when confirmText() or updateTab() is called.
 //!
 //! \param[in] bool on : true indicates the flag is set.
 //!

}
 
 //! Method for classes that capture mouse event events from the visualizers 
 //! (i.e. have manipulators)
 //! This must be reimplemented to respond when the mouse is released.
 //! The mouse release event is received by the VizWin instance, which 
 //! then calls
 //! captureMouseUp() for the EventRouter that is associated with the 
 //! current mouse mode.
 //! Ordinarily this method only needs to redisplay the layout and 
 //! rerender.
 //
 virtual void captureMouseUp() {};
 
 //! Method for classes that capture mouse event events (i.e. have manipulators)
 //! This must be reimplemented to respond appropriately when the mouse 
 //! is pressed.
 //! The mouse press event is received by the VizWin instance, which then calls
 //! captureMouseDown() for the EventRouter that is associated with the 
 //! current mouse mode.
 //! This method should forget any previous text changes, since that would 
 //! confuse the
 //! extents calculation.
 //!
 //! \param[in] mouseNum is 1,2, or 3 for left, middle, or right mouse.
 //!
