//! Bit masks to indicate whether the TFWidget maps constant color
//! to a variable, or maps a secondary color variable
//! COLORVAR_FOR_TF1 - Indicates whether the main MappingFrame/MapperFunction
//! refer to to a color-mapped variable.  This is the case with Barbs, where
//! there is no primary variable.  We don't use the vector variables for our
//! transfer function, we use the color variable.
//! COLORVAR_FOR_TF2 - This indicates whether we need to
//! display an additional transfer function for displaying the colormapped
//! variable, as we do with isosurfaces. IE - when we have a MappingFrame for
//! the primary variable, as well as a MappingFrame for the colormapped variable
//! CONSTANT_COLOR   - Indicates whether constant color options are enabled, for
//! renderers like Barbs and Isosurfaces
