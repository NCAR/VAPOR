Using Vapor 3
=============

Vapor 3 is comprised of a set of tools called Renderers.  Each Renderer visualizes your data in different ways based on your specifications.

We recommend that all users start by working through the :ref:`quickStartGuide`, or watching the video tutorials in the guides for our renderers.

If any feature in Vapor is not sufficienty self describing in the application, this is where to find elaboration.  Please :ref:`contact our team <contactAndContribute>` if you think you may have found a bug, usability issue, or you'd like to request an enhancement.
