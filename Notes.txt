On supporting multiple datamgrs.
-------------------------------

+ datastatus could hold multiple data mgrs. methods like GetExtents() would
operate on all DMs

+ Indivisual renderers would have a DM parameter, not a DataStatus

+ Visualizers would have a DS pointer


On Undo/Redo and session restarts
---------------------------------

ParamsBase has two constructors: one to start from scratch, one to 
construct from an exising XML database. Supporting general undo/redo (such 
as restoring deletion of a renderer or visualizer, or undoing their
creation) probably most easy to do by a complete reconstruction
of *everything*. I.e. treat undo/redo like loading a new session.
Possible to be smarter about this if the determination
of where in the params database changes were made.



	
MouseModeParams
--------------

+ Hardcodes mouse navigation mode type (mouseModeType) for each rendener. Hence, adding a new renderer requires editing MouseModeParams class.

Misc
----

+ Need to disable 2D only renderers if no 2D data are present, and
3d only renderers if no 3D. Otherwise crash.

+ ViewPointEventRouter and VizWinMgr both handle viewpoint change events (former supports "View" tab, latter supports main menu bar. Former is an event
router, latter is not. Both modifiy ViewPointParams. Should VizWinMgr be
made an event router, or possible migrate VizWinMgr "view" functions 
to viewpointeventrouter

+ paint events get generated every time mouse moves anywhere in GUI
