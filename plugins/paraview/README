 How To Build
===============

From the source folder, run:
  ccmake .
  
Then press 'c' to configure, CMake will attempt to find ParaView and the Vapor libraries and include directory. You may need to specify these variables manually:

ParaView_DIR      path to your local ParaView build directory
VAPOR_COMMON_LIB  path to libcommon.so (from Vapor binaries) 
VAPOR_HEADERS     path to Vapor include directory (from Vapor Source)
VAPOR_NETCDF_LIB  path to libnetcdf.so 
VAPOR_VDF_LIB     path to libvdf.so    (from Vapor binaries)

Then press 'c' to configure again. If there are no errors, press 'g' to generate a Makefile and exit ccmake. To build the shared object (plugin) run:
  make
