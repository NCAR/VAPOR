VisIt VDC Reader Plugin

The contents of this directory provide a WASP import
plugin for VisIt (https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/home.html). 


===============
 How To Build
===============

Note:  That you do not need to have built your own version of Visit
or VAPoR, this will work with downloaded binary version.  This code has
been tested Mac and Linux platforms for VisIt 2.9.2 and VAPOR 3.0

----------------------

1) Install VisIt and VAPOR on your system.

2) Edit the WASP.xml file and make sure that the libray and include
paths are correct for your installation of Vapor.  This file is 
located in $VAPOR_HOME/plugins/visit/WASP.  

You will need to set the CXXFLAGS to include:
	WASP.h

The LDFLAGS elements will need to point to the following vapor libs:
	common
	netcdf
	wasp

You may also need to edit the LIBS element (for linux the 'rt'
library is required).

For more information see "Getting Data Into VisIT" available from:
https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/manuals.html

3) Navigate to $VAPOR_HOME/plugins/visit/WASP.  Remove the file 
CMakeCache.txt if it exists.

4) Next to generate the CMakeLists.txt by running:

	xml2cmake -clobber WASP.xml

This command is found in VISITARCHHOME/bin .

6) Use cmake to generate a Makefile, run:

	cmake .

7) Finally, build the binaries by running:

	make clean all

This will build the 4 shared objects which make up the plugin (3
if MPI is not used). The plugin will be installed in the directory
~/.visit/<arch>/plugins/database/

==============================
 Platform Specific Notes
==============================

Mac OS
------

Prior to executing visit the environment variable
DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH must be set to the path where VAPOR's
libraries were installed. For a binary installation of VAPOR this
will be /Applications/VAPOR.app/Contents/MacOS :

	setenv DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH /Applications/VAPOR.app/Contents/MacOS

Linux
-----

On linux systems the library 'rt' must be added to the LIBS element of the 
WASP.xml configuration file.
