//! \class Progress
//! Used for displaying the progress of actions to the user. The actual method
//! for displaying the progress can vary based on the callback.
//!
//! The situations where this should be used is top-level calculations
//! that may take longer than a second. This should not be used (although
//! it will not break) for non-top level calculations, i.e. in the DC library
//! as typically loading data will be part of a higher-level calculation.
//!
//! The primary use case would be a renderer that has to precompute data, e.g.
//! the Flow renderer computing particle advection.
