WASP Installation Instructions

This document provides instructions for building and installing the WASP 
component only of VAPOR. To install VAPOR itself consult only the 
INSTALL.txt document.


Dependencies
------------

WASP depends on Unidata's NetCDF library. The library is available from:

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

WASP has been tested with versions 4.2 and higher.

Unpacking
---------

Unpack the wasp tar file and change directories to the WASP source
directory:

	gunzip wasp-x.x.x-src.tar.gz
	tar xf wasp-x.x.x-src.tar
	cd wasp-x.x.x-src

where 'x.x'x' is the WASP version number

Configuration
-------------

WASP must be configured before it can be compiled. Configuration can be
performed by copying the file 'options.WASP.mk' to  'options.mk', and then
editing the options.mk file:

	cp options.WASP.mk options.mk

A small number of macros in the options.mk file may require editing before
attempting to build WASP. Other macros can be safely ignored. The salient
macros are:

NSTALL_PREFIX_DIR : set this macro to the root of the tree where
you wish to install WASP. WASP will be installed in bin, lib, and
include subdirectories under this directory.

LIB_SEARCH_DIRS : Set this directory to a space-separated list of 
directories containing the libraries WASP depends on (currently only
libnetcdf).

INC_SEARCH_DIRS : Set this directory to a space-separated list of 
directories containing the include files WASP depends on (currently only
netcdf).

Compiling and Installing
------------------------

Once the WASP installation system has been configured, you may
compile by simply typing:

     gmake

or possibly just

     make

if your version of make is gmake compilant.  After compiling the
software, executable and libraries may be installed by executing

     gmake install

Executables, libraries, and header files will be installed to the
installation target directory defined previously in the configuration
step.
