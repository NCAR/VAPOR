VAPOR Application Reference
===========================

VAPOR is comprised of a set of tools called Renderers.  Each Renderer visualizes your data in different ways based on your specifications.

We recommend that all users start by watching some of the video tutorials on our YouTube channel, or working through the :ref:`quickStartGuide`.

If any feature in VAPOR is not sufficienty self describing in the application, this is where to find elaboration.  Please `reach out on our forum <www.vapor.discourse.group>`_ if you think you may have found a bug, usability issue, or you'd like to request an enhancement.
