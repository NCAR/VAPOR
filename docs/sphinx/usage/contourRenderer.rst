Description
-----------

Displays a series of user defined contours along a two dimensional plane within the user's domain.  

Basic Controls
--------------

This renderer contains all of Vapor's standard renderer controls: the :ref:`Variables <variablesTab>`, :ref:`Appearance <appearanceTab>`, :ref:`Geometry <geometryTab>`, and :ref:`Annotation <annotationTab>` tabs.

Like the Image and TwoDData renderers, Contours may be offset by a height variable.

Specialized Controls
--------------------

The Contour Renderer has specialized controls in its Appearance tab, under the heading "Contour Properties".

    *Spacing* controls the incremental increase in data value between contours

    *Count* controls how many contours are currently being drawn

    *Contour Minimum* sets the value of the lowest valued contour in the series
