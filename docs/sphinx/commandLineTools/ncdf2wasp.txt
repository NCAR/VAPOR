    -bs          1           64:64:64        
        Internal storage blocking factor expressed in grid points (NZ:NY:NX) 
        for 3D variables 
    -bs2d        1           ""              
        Internal storage blocking factor expressed in grid points (NZ:NY:NX) 
        for 2D variables. If empty the 2D blocking factor uses the fastest 
        varying dimensions of the 3D blocking factor 
    -cratios     1           500:100:10:1    
        Colon delimited list of compression ratios for 3D variables. The 
        default is 500:100:10:1. The maximum compression ratio is wavelet and 
        block size dependent. 
    -cratios2d   1           ""              
        Colon delimited list of compression ratios for 2D variables. If empty 
        the 2D compression ratio vector is calculated from the 3D compression 
        vector. 
    -debug       0           false           
        Enable diagnostic

    -lod         1           -1              
        Compression levels saved. 0 => coarsest, 1 => next refinement, etc. -1 
        => all levels defined by the netcdf file 
    -nthreads    1           0               
        Specify number of execution threads 0 => use number of cores 
    -quiet       0           false           
        Operate quietly 
    -varname     1           var1            
        Name of variable 
    -wname       1           bior4.4         
        Wavelet family used for compression Valid values are bior1.1, bior1.3, 
        bior1.5, bior2.2, bior2.4 ,bior2.6, bior2.8, bior3.1, bior3.3, bior3.5,

    -xdimnames   1           ""              
        Colon delimited list of dimension names to exclude from compression. 
    -xvarnames   1           ""              
        Colon delimited list of variable names to exclude from compression.
