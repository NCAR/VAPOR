.. _3.6userSurvey:

We need your feedback!
======================

May 21, 2021

We are trying to prioritize new features for Vapor 3.6.Â  Our goal has always been to support scientists and help them produce su
perior visualizations of their simulation data. We can't do this without the feedback of the people in our user community.

Please help us by providing your feedback in the 5 minute survey below, which outlines new features we are considering for Vapor 3.6 and beyond.

`New Feature Survey <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZWvuAXaRiWyFrQ16zO25bfy8AANp8C8HpVXeMk83uQPdTLA/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_

Each feature in the survey is linked to an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/NCAR/VAPOR), so feel free to comment there if you'd like to track our progress, or discuss the issue further after the survey. And please let us know if you have new ideas that we haven't considered yet.

Thank you for helping us produce better open source visualization software.
