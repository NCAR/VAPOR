Release notes for VAPOR-3.3.0

    - Introduced new flow rendering algorithms, including pathlines and streamlines rendered in 3D, as well as the option for density colormapping
    - The Flow renderer can now sample any set of data values along a pathline or streamline, and write those samples to a text file
    - Included a prototype Volume Renderer using Intel's Ospray engine, allowing for 3D rendering of unstructured models like MPAS
    - Improved Vapor's GUI components and architecture for more consistent behavior and improved usability
    - Vapor's sliders no longer have pre-set limits, and can now have their range of values adjusted through a menu opened with a right-mouse click
    - Multiple performance optimizations to Vapor's internal data management system, and the Flow and Image renderers
    - New colormaps, taken from MatPlotLib's cmocean package
    - Updates to Vapor's third-party libraries
