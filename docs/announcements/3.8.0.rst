**New Enhancements**

* 3157 - Jupyter Widgets can now be embedded in Jupyter notebook sessions running Vapor's Python API, and Jupyter notebook visualizers are now interactive so the camera can be repositioned from within a running notebook.

  To install Vapor's Python API:

  * Install `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/>`_ 
  * Run the following commands:

.. code-block::

        conda create -n vapor python=3.9
        conda activate vapor
        conda install -c conda-forge -c ncar-vapor vapor

* 3230 - Allow user to load and save camera viewpoint as a file

**Bug fixes**

* 3280 - VAPOR 3.7 crashes on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* 3257 - VAPOR crashes when run through Rosetta (x86 emulation) on arm64 based M1 Macbook. Missing library?
* 3250 - Particles jump with reduced Y extents

* 3244 - Particles disappear when "Enable 3D Geometry" Disabled
* 3243 - Crash in UnstructuredGrid3D
