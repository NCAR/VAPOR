Vapor can now be scripted with its Python API. Now you can configure a session in Vapor’s GUI with your preferred renderers, then use Python to generate still frames or movies in ways that are difficult if not impossible to do without a script.

3.7 also introduces new enhanced rendering for visualization of Lagrangian particle tracking, the display of dataset metadata, and 93 other enhancements and bug fixes.

Turn on Vapor’s notice board (under Preferences) to get updates on upcoming video tutorials on these new features, and upcoming in-person tutorials.

Thanks!
