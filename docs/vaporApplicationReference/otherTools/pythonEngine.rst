Python Engine
_____________

The Python Engine is a tool that allows users to derive new variables based on the data that exist in their files.  Users need to select input variables that will be read in their script, and they will need to define an output variable.  If the script successfully run by the Python Engine, the output variable will be usable in the same way as the native variables are in the dataset.

The modules *numpy* and *vapor_utils* are available for importation in the Python Engine.

Note: Input variables must exist on the same grid to produce a valid output.
