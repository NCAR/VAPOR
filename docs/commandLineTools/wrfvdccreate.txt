    -bs         1           64:64:64        
        Internal storage blocking factor expressed in grid points (NX:NY:NZ) 
    -cratios    1           1:10:100:500    
        Colon delimited list compression ratios. for 3D variables. The default 
        is 1:10:100:500. The maximum compression ratio is wavelet and block 
        size dependent.

        Create a new VDC master file even if a VDC data directory already 
        exists. Results may be undefined if settings between the new master 
        file and old data directory do not match.

    -vars       1           ""              
        Colon delimited list of 3D variable names (compressed) to be included 
        in the VDC
