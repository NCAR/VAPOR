Lighting Parameters
```````````````````

    *Apply Lighting* - Controls whether Vapor's default light sources are emitted onto the volume during rendering.  The default lights are directional.

    *Ambient* - Controls the amount of ambient light that is absorbed by the volume.  Ambient lights do not have a single directed source, and controls the overall brightness of the scene.

    *Specular* - Controls the angle of reflection for incident light on the volume.  In general, if a volume is very specular, it will appear to have more detail and depth.  It will appear flatter wit

    *Shininess* - Controls the overall reflection of light incident upon the volume.
