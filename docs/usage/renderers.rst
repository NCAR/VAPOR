The Renderers
-------------

Vapor's main utility comes from its suite of Renderers, each of which display simulation data with color and opacity according to user defined parameters.  

Renderers can be captured as still images or animations for analysis, publication, and presentation.  

Below, you can find descriptions of each Renderer and tutorials on how to use them.
