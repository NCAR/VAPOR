Getting Data into Vapor
-----------------------

Vapor can directly import the datasets listed below.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   wrf
   netCDF/netCDF
   rawData
   mpas
   dcp
   
Additionally NetCDF-CF, WRF-ARW, and raw floating point binary files can be converted into a `Vapor Data Collection (VDC) <vdc.html>`_.  This allows users to render their data at different levels of compression to improve rendering time.  See the links above for details on how this can be done.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   vdc
