Raw Binary Data
```````````````

If you have data files that describe your variables with floating point values (single or double precision) or 32 bit integers, Vapor can read your data in two ways.

1) Directly import your data with the Brick of Values (BOV) reader
2) Convert your data into a Vapor Data Collection (VDC), useful for very large datasets
