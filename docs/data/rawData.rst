```````````````

If you have data files that each consist of a single variable written as a floating point values (single or double precision) or 32 bit integers, Vapor can read your data in two ways.

1) Directly import your data with the Brick of Values (BOV) reader
2) Convert your data into a Vapor Data Collection (VDC), useful for very large datasets
