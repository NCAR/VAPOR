What is CF-Compliance?
======================

This means that a given NetCDF file adheres to the `CF Conventions <https://cfconventions.org/>`_.  These conventions exist to provide a common description for NetCDF data.

If Vapor cannot read your data due to it not being compliant, you can find instructions on what to do :ref:`here <cfCompliance>`, and examples on how to achieve CF compliance below.  If you have trouble, contact us :ref:`on our forum <https://vapor.discourse.group/>`.
