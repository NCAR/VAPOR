Dealing with large data: The VDC
________________________________
 
Additionally NetCDF, WRF-ARW, and raw floating point binary files can be converted into a `Vapor Data Collection (VDC) <vdc.html>`_.  This allows users to render their data at different levels of compression to improve rendering time.  See the links above for details on how this can be done.
